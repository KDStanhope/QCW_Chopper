Very simple. 

Sometimes, some residual data of a previous measurement session (or test) still stuck in the data pipeline causes Geocode to crash. 

This allows you to lob a user specified number of megabytes of data from the start then it recompiles a new qcw with header in tact. 

That usually does the trick.
